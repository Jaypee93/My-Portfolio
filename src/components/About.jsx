        All careers in sports must come to an end eventually. During the last
        years my interest in programming and tech in general has grown
        tremendously. Thats why I have decided to pursue a career as a web
        developer. With a large amount of experience in leadership, team work
        and constantly striving to become better, I know that a future in this
        industry suits me well. Im seeking to bring my qualities from my
        professional sports career and strive to become as good of a programmer
        as I can be.
